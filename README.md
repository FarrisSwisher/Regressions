# Regressions
Python script that takes in data points and makes regression curves for the parts with strong correlation


Project 5 in a data science course at the University of Mississippi with Dr. Jones

Each data point essentially has an x, y, and group assignment (frequency)

Two of the frequencies have a strong correlation (> .7) and the rest are pretty much random points on the plot.

For the two with strong correlation, the script creates a linear regression line and a quadratic curve.
